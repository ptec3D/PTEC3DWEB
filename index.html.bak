                Actually, maybe I'll add links to here for a few things. As I

                  can set up rooms to discuss in. My Matrix has rooms for every

                  there are multiple topics and if I added them all into one
                  blog I'd lose readers that weren't (say) interested in ethics
                  of AI as the use of 3D printers. </li>
